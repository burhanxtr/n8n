Welcome to the n8n architecture documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of n8n's system design, components, and architectural patterns.

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to n8n's architecture, start here:

1. **[System Overview](./system-overview.md)** - High-level architecture and core components
2. **[Execution Modes](./execution-modes.md)** - Understanding deployment options (Regular vs Queue mode)
3. **[Data Flow](./data-flow.md)** - How data moves through the system
4. **[Package Architecture](./package-architecture.md)** - Code organization and dependencies

## üîë Key Concepts

### Workflow Execution Model
n8n uses a node-based execution model where workflows are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of nodes. Each node:
- Receives input data from previous nodes
- Processes the data according to its type
- Outputs data for subsequent nodes

### Deployment Flexibility
n8n supports two deployment modes to accommodate different scale requirements:
- **Regular Mode**: Simple, single-process deployment ideal for small to medium workloads
- **Queue Mode**: Scalable, distributed deployment with Redis for high-volume production use

For detailed architecture, configuration, and migration guides, see [Execution Modes](./execution-modes.md).

### Multi-tenancy & Collaboration
- Projects for team organization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Shared workflows and credentials
- Audit logging

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom nodes
- Webhook system for external triggers
- Community nodes support
- REST API for programmatic access

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns through packages
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through queue mode
3. **Security**: Encryption at rest, JWT authentication, RBAC
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin system and community nodes
5. **Performance**: Caching, streaming, and efficient data handling

## üîß For Contributors

### Adding New Services
1. Create service class with `@Service()` decorator
2. Inject dependencies via constructor
3. Register in dependency injection container
4. Add corresponding controller if needed

### Database Changes
1. Create migration in appropriate database folder
2. Use provided migration helpers
3. Test on all supported databases
4. Update entities and repositories

### Adding New Nodes
1. Create node in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/`
2. Implement `INodeType` interface
3. Add credentials if needed
4. Include tests and documentation

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Stream large files, batch operations
- **Execution Optimization**: Expression caching, parallel execution
- **Database Efficiency**: Proper indexing, execution pruning
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory, Redis, database)

## üîí Security Architecture

For comprehensive security details, see [System Overview - Security](./system-overview.md#security-architecture):
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Authorization**: Project-based RBAC via `@n8n/permissions`
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for credentials, TLS for transport
- **Audit**: Comprehensive event logging via event system

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Common Architecture Questions

**Q: When should I use Queue mode?**
A: Use Queue mode when you need high availability, horizontal scaling, or have high workflow volumes. See [Execution Modes](./execution-modes.md#when-to-use-each-mode) for detailed criteria.

**Q: How does n8n handle large files?**
A: Binary data is stored separately (filesystem/S3) with references in the database. See [Data Flow - Binary Data](./data-flow.md#binary-data-handling) for details.

**Q: Can I run multiple main processes?**
A: Yes, in Queue mode you can run multiple main processes behind a load balancer. See [Queue Mode Architecture](./execution-modes.md#queue-mode-architecture).

**Q: How are credentials secured?**
A: Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. See [Security Architecture](./system-overview.md#security-architecture) for details.

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

See [System Overview - Monitoring](./system-overview.md#monitoring--observability) for monitoring architecture and health check endpoints.
