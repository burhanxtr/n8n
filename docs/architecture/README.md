# n8n Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the n8n architecture documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of n8n's system design, components, and architectural patterns.

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to n8n's architecture, start here:

1. **[System Overview](./system-overview.md)** - High-level architecture and core components
2. **[Execution Modes](./execution-modes.md)** - Understanding deployment options (Regular vs Queue mode)
3. **[Data Flow](./data-flow.md)** - How data moves through the system
4. **[Package Architecture](./package-architecture.md)** - Code organization and dependencies

### Visual Diagrams

All diagrams are created with Mermaid and can be found in the [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) directory:

- **[System Components](./diagrams/system-components.mmd)** - Overall system architecture
- **[Execution Flow](./diagrams/execution-flow.mmd)** - Execution state machine
- **[Package Dependencies](./diagrams/package-dependencies.mmd)** - Package relationship graph
- **[Deployment Modes](./diagrams/deployment-modes.mmd)** - Deployment architecture options

## üîë Key Concepts

### Workflow Execution Model
n8n uses a node-based execution model where workflows are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of nodes. Each node:
- Receives input data from previous nodes
- Processes the data according to its type
- Outputs data for subsequent nodes

### Deployment Flexibility
n8n supports two primary deployment modes:
- **Regular Mode**: Simple, single-process deployment
- **Queue Mode**: Scalable, distributed deployment with Redis

### Multi-tenancy & Collaboration
- Projects for team organization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Shared workflows and credentials
- Audit logging

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom nodes
- Webhook system for external triggers
- Community nodes support
- REST API for programmatic access

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns through packages
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through queue mode
3. **Security**: Encryption at rest, JWT authentication, RBAC
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin system and community nodes
5. **Performance**: Caching, streaming, and efficient data handling

## üîß For Contributors

### Adding New Services
1. Create service class with `@Service()` decorator
2. Inject dependencies via constructor
3. Register in dependency injection container
4. Add corresponding controller if needed

### Database Changes
1. Create migration in appropriate database folder
2. Use provided migration helpers
3. Test on all supported databases
4. Update entities and repositories

### Adding New Nodes
1. Create node in `packages/nodes-base/nodes/`
2. Implement `INodeType` interface
3. Add credentials if needed
4. Include tests and documentation

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Stream large files, batch operations
- **Execution Optimization**: Expression caching, parallel execution
- **Database Efficiency**: Proper indexing, execution pruning
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory, Redis, database)

## üîí Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Authorization**: Project-based RBAC
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for credentials, TLS for transport
- **Audit**: Comprehensive event logging

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Common Architecture Questions

**Q: When should I use Queue mode?**
A: Use Queue mode when you need high availability, horizontal scaling, or have high workflow volumes.

**Q: How does n8n handle large files?**
A: Binary data is stored separately (filesystem/S3) with references in the database. Streaming is used for large files.

**Q: Can I run multiple main processes?**
A: Yes, in Queue mode you can run multiple main processes behind a load balancer.

**Q: How are credentials secured?**
A: Credentials are encrypted with AES-256 using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before storage.

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

- Health endpoints: `/healthz` and `/healthz/readiness`
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Structured logging with Winston
- Event bus for audit trails

## üîÑ Future Architecture

Planned improvements include:
- Enhanced plugin system
- Improved workflow compilation
- Better resource isolation
- Multi-region support
